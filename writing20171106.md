=================
Today I'm not in the mood for writing, even if I have time.
No nothing's wrong - I guess this is how it is to write.
I'm glad I'm not a writer!

So what to do? 
Just get the thoughts out so I can sort them and improve on them later.

Skills Quadrant
---------------
I thought about this when I saw someone at RMIT University 
carrying a video camera, while I was 
A skill I don't know at all.

My thinking is how to evaluate skills according to:
I don't know/not important (to me at least - how do I know better?)
vs I don't know/important
vs I know and important
vs I know and unimportant

Understanding the Work Code
---------------------------
Understanding the work/legacy code - how much effort should I put into it?

To make me more effective, and efficient in spending time on those tasks,
vs diminishing returns - how much technology-dependent or specific is it?
How does the technology rank in my personal hierarchy?
vs if I'll only be in the project for a short time, so just learn enough
for the immediate future?

How is the technology, or the skills I will pick up while doing this work,
in terms of my personal roadmap?

Professionalism
---------------
So far I've been talking about individual productivity and practices.
Now we can look at the wider area of teams.
Not about team management or team leadership, but how the individual
developer properly functions within a team.

What is professionalism?
With regards to working in a team environment.
Something as simple as, "Don't break the build"?
