The Organised Way
-----------------

I stumbled upon by chance:

http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2017/07/17/four-reasons-why-developers-are-unproductive.html

Which claims "Not Working in an Organized Way" as one of the reasons.
I agree with the statement that many developers get distracted or don't know
how to begin. I would add, most developers feel this, some of the time.
The article talks about making a plan, but not so much about specific steps 
in doing it. 
I can't specify or even recommend a system, but I'd like to be able to offer
advice on how to derive this system. Comprehensive - even obsessive -
journalling with honest content could provide enough information to work on.

Good habits, well-developed save time by making the development follow a
process or routine. (Of course, routine can be boring and stifle
creativity. How to balance? Open question)

Kent Beck famously said, 
"I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits. "

Honest Journalling
------------------
Earlier I wrote about the self-retro. 
I think a key point here is honesty to one's self.
That is one of the tenets of the agile process as reflected at the retro -
honesty. 
Of course social interactions prevent us from being totally honest to others - 
if one is properly socialised - but one should be honest with one's self.
This is a reason that the work journal should be private - to be able to
write without fear and have everything available for review.

The limitation is if the journal needs to be shared, to as few people
as one's immediate team, or as many as a public blog. 
Since editing takes time and could take away the meaning, maintaining a
separate journal for private and more public use may be needed.

The Spectrum between Imposter Syndrome and Dunning-Kruger Effect
----------------------------------------------------------------
Accurately appraising oneself and one's capabilities is difficult.
One needs to seek the balance between thinking too lowly and thinking too
highly of one's self. 
The Unproductive article mentions incompetence and how it could be normal
and expected despite the notoriety of this word.
Still, it is too easy for a developer to fall into feelings of incompetence
when overwhelmed by all the things they need to know,
and when knowing about and meeting other people who have the skills they
don't have.

Skill sorting
-------------
Journalling helps one appraise their own competence in terms of useful 
their current skills are at the present time, 
in terms of how they were able to use them,
regardless of their absolute skill level.
This helps sort the skills to improve on and pick up into:
what's needed for the current project,
what's needed for the current job,
what might be useful for future jobs,
and "what's good to know" including theory and foundations.

Compare these to what's tempting to learn but not productive, or
would only be limited for a short time - fads.

Sorting would also help identify how to learn them, which is better when
learning with others to achieve a goal, or when using it for a project
with an outcome.
