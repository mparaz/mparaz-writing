=====================

The Self-Retro and Postmortem
-----------------------------
I spent this morning reflecting upon things that have happened at work.
Normally one would discourage this - why think about work when not at work?
You're supposed to separate these? 
But then I find that when taking a step back, and even when not consciously
thinking about things, the insights come in.
This is especially true for non-technical but important things such as 
teamwork and collaboration.

I'm thinking how to distill this process in the framework of the retrospective,
or "retro" as the agile practitioners call it. 
The standard retro is about putting feedback - or thoughts - into the buckets
of what's good, what's bad, what should there be less of, what should there
be more of. 
While I am still skeptical about the whole Agile (the practice, and not the
principles - something I should write about), I find that this form of 
intentional thinking helps focus.
My own practice of self-retro comes well in my note-taking practice.
Since I write notes while working, following my process, at the end of the day
I can look back on the current day, or even further backwards to previous
days, to see what I have done and review what I have missed out.

Forward Planning
----------------
My note-taking process involves writing things before I do them, so that I
know what I have started, and where I have left off if I don't finish.
This follows the concept of reducing the stress of remembering things by
writing them down. I think it is the GTD methodology which brought this up
or reinforces this.

For things I should be doing on the next work day, I write the day and the 
things to do. I'd like to extend this to the future, either for specific
days or for some unspecified week or month in the future. 
Now, while writing this, I realise could also specify some unspecified future.
In line with adopting agile concepts, this could be written as a backlog.

To-do integration and improvement
---------------------------------
I currently use a to-do mobile app for my personal to-do list. 
(It also has a web app but I don't use it.) Mobile is convenient because
it lets me review and reflect while travelling, and during break times at work.
I have removed apps from my phone that give too many machine-generated
notifications, following the Time Well Spent principles, giving me more time
to do this.
I confess though that I might have an addiction to handling notifications or
otherwise interacting with the phone - even if I've quit those compulsive apps,
the compulsion has been replaced with checking to-do items on the phone.
I should be spending more time in quiet reflection.

The To-do list includes concrete things to do, ideas I want to think about, 
and habits -
good habits I want to reinforce, and bad habits I want to break.
I'd like to integrate this with my note-taking.
There are some general work-related thoughts in the to-do list, though I
don't write the details in there.

Notes for the future?
---------------------
I tend to write long tasks and notes in this app, 
probably longer than what the creator intended. 
The ideal scenario would be that I take the note-taking activity to become
overall "life notes", where the to-do app is its outline or summary.
I've written in various handwritten diaries, and blogs, through the years,
but haven't been able to preserve them. 
Now, thinking of the long term, I wonder if there will be value in 
preserving these for the future - my own future reading, or others' ? 
Or if their value is really about the here and now, or the near future.

Time stamping
-------------
The current resolution of my notes is on a daily basis. 
I would like to improve this by putting time stamps on a per thought basis.
While this may seem excessive, it would be useful when doing technical
tasks where one would need to know at what time something was thought of
and then done, for future review. 
Another reason is for the outlining format I use. 
I should expand on this later, but for now I'll say I write in 
numbered outline form, like: 1. 1.1. 1.1.1. ... and the time order of things
I think about and write does not follow the hierarchy. 
For example, I might write in the time order of 1, and 2, and then add 1.1.
because I thought of a sub-category of 1, but I want to put the time sequence
on the record.

Note-taking Categories and Style
--------------------------------
These are some note-taking categories or markers.

To Do: Hopefully self-describing.
Improvement: Something I flag as I can improve on.
Mistake: I want to take note of mistakes and pay extra attention when I review.

I haven't been consistent in the writing style but recently I've been writing
on a first-person basis, with "I think that"... and writing questions 
explicitly like "should I..."
Now, while writing this and taking a step back, 
I feel that this is better since it accurately transcribes the questions
I have in my head (compare against the practice "rubber duck programming"
which I haven't actually done, but this note-taking practice is similar for me
and put things down for the record which is more useful.)
It might also seem more wordier to spell things out like this, 
but I'm fortunate that I'm a fast typist.

The Medium
----------
For confidentiality reasons, I've been writing my work notes on my local
work machine. 
These contain some work intellectual property such as code snippets, error
messages, and log file entries.
So, I don't intend to mix these with my life logging.
What I want to improve on is how to do the life logging without these
details but during work hours so that they are fresh in my mind.
That's easy enough to do with the mobile to-do app since I could take a break
and write them, but the life logging would ideally need a keyboard.
