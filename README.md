Miguel Paraz Writing
====================

1st of November, 2017 - Introduction
====================================

I have been saying I'll begin writing again. 
I used to blog diligently.
I used to be open about sharing. 
Now, not so much. 
I'm more careful in what I reveal online, 
unlike before where I took pride in sharing the 
minute details. 
I have different pieces of writing scattered all over the web
that make up the story of my life. I won't continue that.

I said I would also like to write more about technical topics.
The challenge here is that I'm not very open about what I'm working for on
the job, unlike other technical bloggers who easily log what they are doing -
or even companies who share a great deal of technical detail.

Personal Productivity for Developers
------------------------------------

Instead, I think I'll focus on personal productivity for developers.
This has been an interest - or obsession - of mine.
This is how about a software developer - or software engineer, or programmer -
can improve their productivity at their own personal level. 
This is different from software team productivity, which is the focus of
software engineering practices and management. 
This has already been studied a lot, and talked about even more.
This is also different from personal productivity and self-improvement in
general, such as time management techniques (like Getting Things Done), 
and study techniques (like Deep Work). 

I already have some prototype practices, most significantly,
how I take down notes and write things down while working. 
This could still be improved, which I hope to do while writing about it here
since this process helps me reflect upon what I'm doing.
Throughout the work day I'll also log how I'm doing things and extract out
what I can generalise and share.

"Now"
----
Another concept I'd like to improve is maintaining the page of 
"what you're doing now". I've read someone write about this and have seen
a few examples. It's like a throwback to the old blogging days, before 
social networks. This is timely because I've decided to cut down on both
social networks and mobile notifications. I'll write more about that.

"Now" could also include articles I read - which are a lot - 
and my thoughts on them. Longer thoughts could lead to full articles.
I'd need to improve my process of tracking down or bookmarking what I read.

Projects and Learning
---------------------
I am working on some non-day-job projects that I could write about.
The limitation is that I only have so much time for them, and that's better
spent on doing the technical work. Writing could be a way of taking a break
from the tech but still helping with the project.

I am also learning some technologies. I am always learning. 
I haven't been great at writing about them.
I have beeen OK at applying them to the job or projects, but writing would
give me a chance to share more knowledge and reinforce my learning.

Process
-------
I'll continue writing this document, "in white heat", and will edit it
"in cold blood" at the end of the writing session - 
November, thanks to NaNoWriMo and its variations. 
Then, I'll edit it into something useful. 
It would be ideal if I could publish something every day, 
but if I were to publish polished articles I wouldn't make that frequency.


Technical Details
-----------------
I'm just writing this using the vim editor and in the Markdown formatting
system. For now I'll just rely on GitHub to format it - not that there's much!
Later I'll look at better ways of publishing.

2nd of November 2017
====================

Sleep and money, things that challenge is in modern life.
I've started reading two books, Why We Sleep and Curing Affluenza.
We feel like we need to do so many things - and cut down on sleep.
We feel like we need to acquire new things - and increase our buying.

Sleeping is the bigger problem for me.
When I cut down on sleep it's when I stay up late, thinking, there's so much
to do. And there really is. I need to prioritise. 
Choosing things to do is like buying new things, in that they take up
resources in our life - time, space, and mental overhead.

And so, improving my productivity should be taking steps in improving my
sleep, and thus overall health and quality of life. 
Improving productivity is not only doing things in better ways, 
but also being more mindful of what I do, and considering not doing some things.

This relates to self-improvement as a developer.
There are so many technologies one could learn, and it is no longer feasible
to learn them all. 
I could spend time reading on them, but they become simply leisure if they
don't get to be used. Really learning them can only be achieved by using them.
I need to balance between technologies that I need right now, 
those that look like I will need soon in my current work, 
those that I might need for future jobs,
and those that I need to know for background, or theoretical knowledge.
I need to choose projects that will move me along these goals.
