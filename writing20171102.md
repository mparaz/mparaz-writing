====================

Sleep and money, things that challenge is in modern life.
I've started reading two books, Why We Sleep and Curing Affluenza.
We feel like we need to do so many things - and cut down on sleep.
We feel like we need to acquire new things - and increase our buying.

Sleeping is the bigger problem for me.
When I cut down on sleep it's when I stay up late, thinking, there's so much
to do. And there really is. I need to prioritise. 
Choosing things to do is like buying new things, in that they take up
resources in our life - time, space, and mental overhead.

And so, improving my productivity should be taking steps in improving my
sleep, and thus overall health and quality of life. 
Improving productivity is not only doing things in better ways, 
but also being more mindful of what I do, and considering not doing some things.

This relates to self-improvement as a developer.
There are so many technologies one could learn, and it is no longer feasible
to learn them all. 
I could spend time reading on them, but they become simply leisure if they
don't get to be used. Really learning them can only be achieved by using them.
I need to balance between technologies that I need right now, 
those that look like I will need soon in my current work, 
those that I might need for future jobs,
and those that I need to know for background, or theoretical knowledge.
I need to choose projects that will move me along these goals.
